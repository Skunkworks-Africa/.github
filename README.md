# Skunkworks.github.io

Welcome to the Skunkworks project page. This site is dedicated to showcasing our latest innovations and experimental projects in software development.

## About

Skunkworks is a term traditionally used to describe a group within an organization given a high degree of autonomy and unhampered by bureaucracy, tasked with working on advanced or secret projects. Here, we apply the same principle to software development, creating cutting-edge applications and tools.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects we're currently working on:

- **Project Phoenix**: An AI-driven code optimizer that learns from your coding style to suggest efficiency improvements.
- **Quantum Leap**: A web-based simulator for quantum computing algorithms, designed for educational purposes.
